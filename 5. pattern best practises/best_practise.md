# Design pattern and Consitency
there are universal principle you should apply when ever you develop 
software application. consitency is one of the hallmarks of sound software 
engineering one of resigon we recommend using design patterns is to promote
the consitency of the code. if an identical solution is used repeatedaly to 
solve the same problems, developer need to modify only one piece of code 
when there is need to change the code otherwise you end up spending much more
time different stratiges for different solutions implemnting through out the code
to accomodate the requirements

The benifit of promoting consitency also includes
- reducing the risk of making mistakes
- since same piece of code is used over and over again 
- another benifit is increasing the possibility of detecting the errors since more set
  of eyes lookings at the same code may spot the code more quickly
- saving the cost of software developemnts is another benifit
  since you reuse the well-established solutions in the form of patterns in their in-house
  of third party Implemnetaions. 
- A large scale way of accomplishing consistency is by creating a software artitecture
  and trying to stick to it.
- This could be simple as identifying patterns to be used throught your software coherantly.
- another way of enforcing consitency is using frameworks.
- Frameworks consist of design patterns put together in a specific fashion to accomplish
  a particular goals for example, there are frameworks specializing in improving software
  security, while there are frameworks whose focus is providing a related set of functionalities
  such as building an e-commerce website. consitency is one of the most critical software enginering
  principles and use of design pattern makes your job easier to keep your code consistent.

# Programmer's mindset
using design pattern also promotes the other ideal qualities of software
such as completeness and correctenss. completeness refers to how much a 
software solution meets its requirements. since design pattern are community driven
and validate according to the desired requirements, you can safely assume they
need the baseline requirements however onthing to notice that deisgn patterns
are intentionally under defined to allow potential customization and extension
efforts
correcteness is another essesntial quality of well developed softare
correctness is vital in mission critical system such as power palnt and water treatemnts facilities 

coupling and cohesion:
coupling and cohesion also what design pattern address.the term coupling means
how many differnt elemnets of your software are related. if there is strong coupling
within the software elements, changes in one of them affect the other significantly.
which means a lot of works.on the other hand cohesion refer to how independet
a software componemnts is therfore more cohesion is better but less coupling 
is desirable, which is the goal of design patterns.

the tradeoof between simplicity and generality is also what design
patterns consider.
for wider adapton, design pattern may attempt to satisfy too many
requirements and become too complicated for it to be truly useful.
however, it's also important to be general enopugh for reusability
purposes. design pattern should be simple enough to be quickly master 
highly usable practioners. when considering using design patterns,
keep in mind these design principles to ensure you are actually
improving the quality of software by adapting them.
